# Automatic-Weather-Stations-AWS-for-Schools
Automatic weather stations are extensively used to collect data from sites and locations which are remote, difficult to access or even from other locations to save the human labor and avoid human error. For a weather forecast to be successful, in spite of its accuracy it has to be disseminated and presented in a way that allows the students to actually receive, understand and act upon the information. The proposed Automatic Weather Station aims to measure several meteorological parameters such as Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Rainfall, Wind Speed and Wind Direction. It will be designed and built for the long-term use under extreme weather conditions. This AWS will gather high-quality real-time data and this data will be made accessible to all the students using an online portal such as a website or an app.
